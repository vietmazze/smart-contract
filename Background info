Linked List: linear collection of data elements, it is a data structure of a collection of nodes* which together represent a sequence. A node is a
             basic unit used in comp science. It's a data point of a large data structure. Node in a linked list must be read in order from the begining as 
             list are inherently sequential access. 
             
             -list elements can be easily inserted or remove without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure. Yet linked lists by 
             themselves do not allow "random access"

Binary search tree: a binary tree in which for each node, a value of all the nodes in left subtree is lesser or equal and value of all the nodes in the right subtree is greater.
                    When searching in a binary tree, we look at the root and compare the search value. We know in binary tree, the lesser of the root will be on the left and so on.
                    Binary tree allows us to discard subtrees and so on since we start at the root and work our way down, nothing the left has values less of the root and right always
                    has value greater than root. This help binary tree to be fast lookup, addition and removal of items. 
              
Hash Table: a structure that can map keys to value by using a hash function. Example: Putting a name into a hash through a hash function.
